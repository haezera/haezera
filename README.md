  <h2> Who are you?</h2>
  I'm a first year, Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science student who is minoring in Mathematics. My interests are everywhere at the moment, as I let myself enjoy and explore multiple different fields of CS and SWE. <br>
A more extensive introduction can be found at <a href="https://haezera.github.io" target="_blank">my website</a>
  <h2>What are you working on?</h2>
  Currently, I'm working on a few projects which are aimed at just bettering my software engineering skills. These include:
    <h3>pytrading</h3>
    pytrading implements multiple well known trading stratgies, such as Simple Moving Average (SMA), Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and Awesome Oscillator (AO). There have already been multiple features implemented - please check out the repository for more info!
    <h3>personal portfolio website</h3>
    My personal portfolio website is constantly being maintained and updated with more information and things I want to add. It was made with HTML/CSS/JS, and was my first introduction to web development.
